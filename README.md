# wxLedIndicator

This is a wxWidgets implementation of an LED indicator. The code was taken from the forum thread https://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?t=48230. I figured adding this to a github repository would be good for anyone looking to quickly import it or use it as a submodule (as I have) in their code.

***Note:*** I haven't created this, just adding it to a repo for easy use and finding
